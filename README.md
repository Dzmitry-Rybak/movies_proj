## Project Description

This is a project that I worked on while learning Javascript on Udemy. The project was provided by the instructor and I used it to practice and improve my Javascript skills. It involved building various features and functionalities using vanilla Javascript, including DOM manipulation. The project allowed me to gain practical experience and apply what I learned in a real-world context.
